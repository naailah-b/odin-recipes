        <p>
            Simple cake. simple paragraph. so simple in fact that i am not using capital letters. will writing be useful
            in the future? the future in which i am not sure exists? the future where i will hopefully not be doing this. 
            simple writing. i will never write a paragraph about cake. a thousand word essay in eigth grade about cake was
            enough for me. i am done. cake is yum.
